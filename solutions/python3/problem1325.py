1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value

Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if it's parent node becomes a leaf node
and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you can't).


Constraints:
1 <= target <= 1000
The given binary tree will have between 1 and 3000 nodes.
Each node's value is between [1, 1000].
